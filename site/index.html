<h2>Financial aid form (because I'm venezuelan and I can't afford to pay for my studies abroad</h2>
<p>Why are you applying for Financial Aid? (150 words minimum required)</p>
<p>
	
My country (Venezuela) is not allowing their inhabitants to use any kind of foreign currency, only Bolivars (the local currency only), and maybe we have the lowest monthly income in the entire world (even being a professional like in my case my monthly income is under $10). Considering this, I just can afford the basic stuff: buy some food with limitations and pay the basic services and taxes. Basically our governors have severe restrictions to us to access any thing outside here, because they have completely under their control the use and distribution of foreign currencies, and we have more than 5 years without the possibility to use our credit cards or Banks to convert our VEF to USD or any other currency.  Addtionally, all these restrictions and blocks that we are facing seem to not change in the near future, we have a kind of masked dictatorship and in the upcoming presidential elections will not make any difference because they have all the powers and even candidates on their favor.

<p>How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals? (150 words minimum required)</p>
<p>
I'm making big efforts to keep going with a "normal" lifestyle in this country (Venezuela), but considering the poor conditions to stay here, I really need to improve and update my skills to find a decent job remotely or relocate myself at any country where I'm able to feel more safe and with real development opportunities. As an IT (my profession is Informatics Engineer) with several years of experience, I need to stay up to date with the most recent and relevant technologies. In  my field of knowledge is vital to keep yourself in continuos formation and to study more than a single course. This field requires to combine several things to be a qualified person to apply for a job at any place, for this reason, for me is very important to improve constantly my skills and have a way to demonstrate (in this case a certificate) that I have proofs of my abilities.
